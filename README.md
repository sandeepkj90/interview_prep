Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of AWS EC2 service-related interview questions from basic to advanced levels, along with answers and examples:

---

### **Basic-Level Questions**

#### **1. What is Amazon EC2?**
**Answer:**
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud. It enables users to launch virtual servers, known as instances, to run applications.

---

#### **2. What are the types of EC2 instances?**
**Answer:**
EC2 instances are categorized into different families based on their use cases:
- **General Purpose (e.g., t2, t3, m5):** Balanced CPU and memory.
- **Compute Optimized (e.g., c5):** High-performance processors for compute-intensive tasks.
- **Memory Optimized (e.g., r5, x1):** High memory-to-CPU ratio.
- **Storage Optimized (e.g., i3, d2):** High disk throughput and storage capacity.
- **Accelerated Computing (e.g., p3, g4):** GPUs for machine learning and gaming.

---

#### **3. What is an AMI in EC2?**
**Answer:**
AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template used to create instances. It contains the operating system, application server, and applications.

---

#### **4. How do you launch an EC2 instance?**
**Answer:**
You can launch an instance using the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK.

**Example using CLI:**
```bash
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345678 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name MyKeyPair --security-group-ids sg-12345678 --subnet-id subnet-12345678
```

---

#### **5. What is a Security Group in EC2?**
**Answer:**
A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.

---

#### **6. What are EC2 instance states?**
**Answer:**
- **Pending:** Instance is being launched.
- **Running:** Instance is up and running.
- **Stopping:** Instance is being stopped.
- **Stopped:** Instance is stopped.
- **Terminated:** Instance is permanently deleted.

---

#### **7. How is pricing calculated for EC2 instances?**
**Answer:**
Pricing is based on the following:
- Instance type and size.
- Region.
- On-demand, reserved, or spot instances.
- Additional costs (e.g., storage, data transfer).

---

### **Intermediate-Level Questions**

#### **8. What are the different pricing models in EC2?**
**Answer:**
- **On-Demand Instances:** Pay for compute capacity per hour or second.
- **Reserved Instances:** Significant discounts for committing to 1- or 3-year terms.
- **Spot Instances:** Up to 90% discounts for unused EC2 capacity.
- **Dedicated Hosts:** Physical servers for regulatory requirements.
- **Savings Plans:** Flexible savings based on usage.

---

#### **9. How do you resize an EC2 instance?**
**Answer:**
1. Stop the instance.
2. Modify the instance type.
3. Start the instance.

**Example using CLI:**
```bash
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-12345678 --instance-type "{\"Value\": \"t3.medium\"}"
```

---

#### **10. What is Elastic IP in EC2?**
**Answer:**
An Elastic IP is a static, public IPv4 address that you can associate with an EC2 instance. It remains constant even if the instance is stopped or restarted.

---

#### **11. How do you connect to an EC2 instance?**
**Answer:**
Using an SSH client:
```bash
ssh -i "MyKeyPair.pem" ec2-user@<Public_IP>
```

---

#### **12. What is an EC2 Placement Group?**
**Answer:**
A Placement Group determines how instances are placed on hardware:
- **Cluster:** Low-latency, high-throughput workloads.
- **Spread:** Instances spread across hardware to reduce failure impact.
- **Partition:** Instances divided into partitions, suitable for big data.

---

#### **13. What is the difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance?**
**Answer:**
- **Stop:** Halts the instance but retains storage (EBS).
- **Terminate:** Deletes the instance and associated storage (EBS, unless configured otherwise).

---

#### **14. How can you monitor EC2 instances?**
**Answer:**
- **CloudWatch:** Monitors CPU, disk, network, and memory usage.
- **CloudTrail:** Tracks API calls.
- **AWS CLI:** Fetch instance metrics.

**Example using CLI:**
```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --metric-name CPUUtilization --namespace AWS/EC2 --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-12345678 --start-time 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z --end-time 2023-01-01T23:59:59Z --period 300 --statistics Average
```

---

#### **15. What is EC2 Auto Scaling?**
**Answer:**
Auto Scaling ensures EC2 capacity adjusts automatically based on demand.

---

### **Advanced-Level Questions**

#### **16. What are Spot Instances, and how do they work?**
**Answer:**
Spot Instances allow you to bid for unused EC2 capacity at discounted rates. Instances can be terminated if the price exceeds your bid.

---

#### **17. How do you set up an EC2 instance for high availability?**
**Answer:**
1. Use **Auto Scaling Groups** across multiple Availability Zones.
2. Attach instances to a **Load Balancer** for traffic distribution.
3. Use **Elastic IPs** for static access.

---

#### **18. What is the difference between EBS and Instance Store?**
**Answer:**
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store):** Persistent storage, data persists even after instance termination.
- **Instance Store:** Ephemeral storage, data is lost when the instance stops or terminates.

---

#### **19. How do you encrypt EBS volumes attached to EC2 instances?**
**Answer:**
1. Use an encrypted AMI to launch the instance.
2. Create an encrypted snapshot of an unencrypted volume.
3. Enable encryption while creating a new EBS volume.

---

#### **20. How does EC2 integrate with IAM?**
**Answer:**
IAM roles can be attached to EC2 instances to grant permissions for accessing other AWS services without using access keys.

---

#### **21. How can you implement Load Balancing with EC2?**
**Answer:**
Use an **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** to distribute incoming traffic across EC2 instances in one or more Availability Zones.

---

#### **22. What is the difference between EC2 Hibernate and Stop?**
**Answer:**
- **Stop:** Halts the instance; data is saved only on EBS volumes.
- **Hibernate:** Saves the instance's RAM to the root volume and resumes from the saved state.

---

#### **23. How do you troubleshoot EC2 instance connection issues?**
**Answer:**
- Check **Security Groups** and ensure port 22 (SSH) is open.
- Verify the **key pair** matches.
- Confirm the **Elastic IP** or public IP.
- Use **CloudWatch Logs** for detailed error logs.

---

#### **24. What is EC2 Instance Metadata?**
**Answer:**
Metadata provides information about an instance, such as public IP, instance ID, etc.

**Example:**
```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

---

#### **25. What are the different ways to optimize EC2 costs?**
**Answer:**
- Use **Spot Instances** or **Reserved Instances** for predictable workloads.
- Right-size instances based on utilization.
- Leverage **Savings Plans**.
- Use **Auto Scaling** to match capacity with demand.
