Got it ✅ Thanks for sharing — you’re a **Python backend senior**.

Here’s how that plays out in the **Dubai job market**:

---

## 🔥 Demand for Senior Python Backend Developers

- **High Demand**: Python is very sought after in Dubai, especially for **backend APIs**, **microservices**, and **automation**.
- **Extra Strong in Data/AI**: Many UAE companies (finance, healthcare, government, logistics, startups) are investing in **data engineering, AI/ML, analytics**, where Python is #1.
- **Cloud + Backend**: If you pair Python with **cloud skills (AWS, Azure, GCP)** and **databases (Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis)**, your profile stands out.
- **Frameworks**: Companies expect seniors to know **Django**, **FastAPI**, or **Flask** (FastAPI is getting especially popular in new projects).

---

## 💰 Salary & Roles

- **Senior Python Backend Engineers** in Dubai typically earn **AED 25,000 – 40,000/month** (USD \~6.8k–11k).
- Roles often advertised as:

  - **Senior Backend Engineer (Python)**
  - **Data Engineer / ML Engineer**
  - **Full-stack Python (with React/Node)**
  - **Solution Architect (Python / Cloud)**

---

## 🆚 How You Compare to Other Languages

- Compared to **JavaScript/TypeScript**: You’ll have _fewer raw job listings_, but **higher pay** and **less competition** because fewer seniors specialize in Python.

## ✅ What To Do Next (for Dubai market)

2. **Show Data/AI Edge** (if you have it): Pandas, NumPy, ML, or even just experience integrating with AI/ML pipelines — big plus.
3. **Add Cloud Certs** (AWS/Azure/GCP): Many Dubai companies filter resumes by this.
4. **Learn FastAPI** (if not already): It’s very hot in the UAE for new projects.
5. **Target Sectors**: FinTech, Logistics, Healthcare, Government smart-city projects — all heavy on Python backend.
