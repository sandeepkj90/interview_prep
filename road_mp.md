Excellent mindset 💪 — let’s get **super practical** now.

You already know _where_ you want to go (a high-paying product-based company), and you’ve got 10 years of solid backend + frontend experience.
Now we’ll break this down into a **step-by-step execution plan** — what to do **first, second, third**, and how each step builds toward your goal.

# 🧭 Step-by-Step Flow to Transition from Service to Product Company

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Set the Ground — Mindset & Direction (Days 1–2)

**Goal:** Create clarity and commit to a learning routine.

✅ **Action Plan:**

1. Write down your **target job role** and companies (e.g., “Full Stack Engineer @ Swiggy, Razorpay, Meesho, Zoho”).
2. Block **2–3 hours daily** for focused learning. Treat it like your gym time.
3. Create a simple **Notion / Google Sheet** with these columns:

   - Date
   - Topic
   - Progress %
   - Notes
   - Project / Code Link

🎯 Output: You have a schedule, workspace, and motivation setup.

### Week 1–2 → Learn TypeScript + Advanced JS

✅ **Actions:**

- Learn TypeScript daily (interfaces, generics, utility types).
- Convert one small Node or React project from JS → TS.
- Deep dive into:

  - Event Loop, Call Stack, Promises, async/await
  - Debounce, Throttle, Memoization

📚 Resources:

- _TypeScript Docs_

  - JWT Authentication, Pagination, Validation

- Write one **production-grade REST API** with:

  - Express.js + MongoDB + Redis
  - Testing (Jest / Mocha)
  - Deployment (Render / Railway)

- Document everything in a GitHub repo.

📚 Resources:

- Book: _Node.js Design Patterns (Mario Casciaro)_
- YouTube: Harkirat Singh backend playlist

🎯 Output: “Pro-level” Node.js understanding + one solid project.

## 🔹 Step 3: Strengthen DSA (Days 10–90, parallel)

**Goal:** Be able to clear product interviews confidently.

✅ **Actions:**

- Solve **1 problem daily (LeetCode Easy → Medium)**
- Follow the **NeetCode roadmap** (by pattern):

  - Week 1–2: Arrays, Strings
  - Week 3–4: HashMaps, Sliding Window
  - Week 5–6: Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists
  - Week 7–8: Trees, Graphs, Recursion
  - Week 9–10: Dynamic Programming (basic)

⏰ 1 hour daily is enough, but be consistent.

📚 Resources:

- LeetCode
- NeetCode.io
- Educative: _Grokking the Coding Interview_

🎯 Output: Solve 50–70 problems confidently.

---

## 🔹 Step 4: React + Next.js Mastery (Days 31–45)

**Goal:** Build performance-optimized UIs like a product engineer.

✅ **Actions:**

- Review advanced React topics:

  - React Query / TanStack Query
  - Redux Toolkit / Zustand
  - Lazy loading, Suspense
  - useCallback / useMemo

- Learn **Next.js (v14)** for SSR, routing, SEO, and API routes.
- Build a project:

  - **“Feedback Hub”** — Next.js + Node.js + MongoDB + Redis
  - Features: Auth, CRUD feedback, upvotes, charts, dark mode
  - Deploy: Frontend (Vercel), Backend (Render)

📚 Resources:

- Next.js official docs
- EpicReact.dev (Kent C. Dodds)
- YouTube: PedroTech / Codevolution

🎯 Output: A complete deployed app you can show recruiters.

---

## 🔹 Step 5: System Design Learning (Days 46–70)

**Goal:** Learn how to build large-scale systems (a must for senior roles).

✅ **Actions:**

- Learn key concepts:

  - Load Balancing, Caching, CDNs
  - Message Queues, Pub/Sub
  - Database Sharding & Indexing
  - Scalability, Fault Tolerance

- Study popular designs:

  - URL Shortener
  - Twitter Feed System
  - Uber / WhatsApp backend

- Start explaining these aloud or draw on paper.

📚 Resources:

- _System Design Primer (GitHub)_
- _Grokking the System Design Interview (Educative)_
- YouTube: Gaurav Sen, Tech Dummies

🎯 Output: Can explain and design a scalable system end-to-end.

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Resume, Portfolio, and Branding (Days 71–80)

**Goal:** Make your experience _look product-grade_.

✅ **Actions:**

- Write resume focusing on **impact + ownership**:

  - ❌ “Worked on API development”
  - ✅ “Designed and deployed scalable APIs handling 10K+ requests/day reducing latency by 30%.”

- Add:

  - Project Links (GitHub + Deployed)
  - Skills: Node.js, TypeScript, React, MongoDB, Redis, System Design
  - Metrics wherever possible

- Update LinkedIn headline & start posting short learnings weekly.
- Build a **portfolio site** (Next.js + Tailwind).

🎯 Output: Recruiter-attracting professional brand.

---

## 🔹 Step 7: Interview Practice (Days 81–90)

**Goal:** Crack real interviews.

✅ **Actions:**

- 2 LeetCode problems daily (review patterns)
- 2 mock interviews/week (coding + design)
- Behavioral questions practice (STAR format):

  - “Tell me about a time you improved performance.”
  - “Describe a challenge and how you solved it.”

- Practice explaining your projects with metrics.

📚 Platforms:

- Pramp (free mock interviews)
- InterviewBuddy / Interviewing.io

🎯 Output: You can confidently code, design, and explain your work.

---

## 🔹 Step 8: Apply Strategically (Post-Day 90)

✅ **Actions:**

- Start with product startups → mid-tier → unicorns (Swiggy, Razorpay, Gojek, Zoho, etc.)
- Use platforms:

  - LinkedIn (referrals via DMs)
  - AngelList / Wellfound
  - Cutshort / Hirect (for startups)

- For every 10 applications → track responses in your Notion sheet.
- Keep improving based on interview feedback.

🎯 Output: Product job offer (target 1–2 months after Day 90).
