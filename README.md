Here’s a comprehensive list of **scenario-based practical React.js interview questions**, organized by topic. These questions are aimed at testing your ability to handle real-world problems and implement solutions using React.

---

## **Component Design and Functionality**
1. Create a reusable button component with different styles based on props (e.g., `primary`, `secondary`, `disabled`).
2. Build a modal component that opens and closes on button click.
3. Design a dropdown menu component that dynamically updates its options based on data from an API.
4. Implement a tabbed interface where clicking on a tab shows its associated content.
5. Create a dynamic table component with sortable columns and paginated data.

## **State Management and Hooks**
6. Implement a counter with increment, decrement, and reset functionalities using `useState`.
7. Build a to-do list application with the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks.
8. Create a product filter for an e-commerce site using `useReducer` to manage filter states.
9. Fetch data from an API using `useEffect` and display it in a component. Include a loading spinner and error message.
10. Write a custom hook to handle form validation for inputs like email, password, and username.
11. Use `useContext` to manage and share a theme (light/dark) across components.
12. Implement a live search feature that fetches suggestions as the user types using debouncing with `useEffect`.

---

## **Performance Optimization**
13. Optimize a list of items to prevent unnecessary re-renders using `React.memo`.
14. Create a component that uses `useMemo` to compute and display a heavy calculation only when inputs change.
15. Implement a parent-child component relationship where the parent passes a callback function to the child, and optimize it using `useCallback`.

---

## **Routing and Navigation**
16. Create a multi-page app using React Router, including a home page, about page, and user profile page.
17. Implement protected routes that only allow access to authenticated users.
18. Handle route parameters and query strings to display user-specific data on a profile page.
19. Implement a 404 error page for undefined routes using React Router.

---

## **Forms and Validation**
20. Create a login form with controlled components for email and password inputs.
21. Build a multi-step form where the user can navigate between steps and review all inputs at the end.
22. Implement form validation with error messages for invalid inputs using libraries like Formik or custom validation logic.
23. Design a file upload component that displays the uploaded file’s name and progress.

---

## **API Integration**
24. Fetch and display paginated data from an API, with "Load More" functionality.
25. Implement infinite scrolling for a list of items loaded from an API.
26. Build a weather app that fetches real-time weather data based on user input.
27. Create a data visualization dashboard by fetching data from an API and displaying it using charts or graphs.

---

## **Context API and State Management Libraries**
28. Use Context API to create a global state for managing user authentication.
29. Implement a global cart management system for an e-commerce application using Redux or Zustand.
30. Create a notification system that displays alerts (success, error, warning) using Context API.
31. Implement a dark mode toggle using Context API.

---

## **Advanced Features**
32. Implement a file uploader with drag-and-drop support and progress visualization.
33. Create a chat application with real-time updates using WebSockets.
34. Build a component that dynamically renders based on user permissions.
35. Implement lazy loading for images in a list of posts.
36. Create a component that renders a tooltip when hovering over an element.
37. Build a video player with play, pause, and volume control features.

---

## **Error Handling**
38. Handle API errors gracefully in a React component and display appropriate error messages.
39. Create an error boundary to catch JavaScript errors in a React component tree and display a fallback UI.

---

## **Code Splitting and Optimization**
40. Implement code splitting in a React app using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
41. Split a large component into smaller components to improve readability and maintainability.
42. Use dynamic imports to load specific parts of a library or component only when needed.

---

## **Testing**
43. Write a test case using Jest and React Testing Library to check if a component renders correctly.
44. Test an input form to ensure it displays error messages for invalid inputs.
45. Write a test for a component that fetches and displays API data, including mocking the API response.

---

## **UI/UX Scenarios**
46. Create a responsive navbar with a hamburger menu for mobile devices.
47. Implement a "scroll to top" button that appears when the user scrolls down.
48. Build a skeleton loader for a component that fetches and displays data.
49. Create a carousel/slider component that rotates through images automatically.
50. Implement a star rating system where users can rate items from 1 to 5 stars.
