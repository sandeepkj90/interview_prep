While AlgoMaster.io does not offer a direct "Download PDF" button for the roadmap on their free tier, I have extracted the complete DSA Course Roadmap from the page for you.

You can copy the checklist below into a Word document or Google Doc and then **"Save as PDF"** or simply press **Ctrl + P** on this page to print it directly for tracking.
