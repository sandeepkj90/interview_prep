    - Allow users to retry a CRUD operation if it fails due to network issues.

22. **Field-Level Validation:**

    - Add validation to forms for creating or updating items. Prevent submission if validation fails (e.g., a required field is empty).

23. **Global Error Handling:**

    - Implement a global error boundary to catch and display errors from failed CRUD operations.

24. **Handle API Rate Limits:**
    - Gracefully handle situations where the API enforces rate limits. Show appropriate messages or implement a retry mechanism.

### **Libraries and Tools for CRUD**

25. **React Query:**

    - Use React Query to handle data fetching and caching for CRUD operations.

26. **Redux Toolkit:**

    - Implement CRUD operations using Redux Toolkit to manage global state and API interactions.

27. **Axios Interceptors:**

    - Use Axios interceptors to log, retry, or modify API requests for CRUD operations.

28. **GraphQL CRUD:**
    - Use Apollo Client to implement CRUD operations with a GraphQL backend.

### **Real-World Scenarios**

29. **Todo App:**
    -
30. **User Management:**

    - Build a user management system where admins can create, update, delete, and view users.

31. **Product Inventory:**

    - Create an inventory management system for an e-commerce app, including CRUD operations for products, categories, and stock levels.

32. **Blog Management:**

    - Build a blogging platform where users can create, edit, delete, and view blog posts. Add the ability to manage comments for each post.

33. **Customer Feedback System:**
    - Develop a feedback system where customers can submit, update, or delete feedback, and admins can manage all entries.

---

### **Testing CRUD Operations**

34. **Unit Tests:**

    - Write unit tests to verify CRUD operations work as expected (e.g., API calls return the correct data).

35. **Integration Tests:**

    - Use a testing library like React Testing Library to test the integration of CRUD features with the UI.

36. **Error Scenarios:**

    - Simulate API failures (e.g., 404 or 500 errors) and test how the application handles them.

37. **Mocking API Responses:**
    - Use libraries like MSW (Mock Service Worker) to mock API responses during testing.

---

### **UX Enhancements**

38. **Undo Functionality:**

    - Add an "Undo" option after a delete operation to restore the deleted item.

39. **Auto-Save for Update:**

    - Implement auto-save functionality for editable items, so changes are saved automatically after a short delay.

40. **Offline Support:**
    - Allow CRUD operations to work offline. Sync changes with the backend when the app reconnects to the internet.
