That’s a fantastic goal — and you’re already halfway there with solid experience in **Node.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, and React**. Moving from a _service-based_ company to a _product-based_ company requires a strategic combination of **technical depth, problem-solving skills, and professional branding**.

Let’s build a **step-by-step roadmap** that covers everything — **skills, interview prep, projects, resume, and daily routine** — so you can make the leap confidently.

---

## 🎯 Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–3)

### 1. Strengthen Your Core Skills

You already know JS/Node/React — now go **deeper**.

**Backend (Node.js + MongoDB):**

- Learn about **scalable architecture** — microservices, caching, message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka).
- Study **database design patterns**, **indexes**, and **query optimization** in MongoDB.
- Build RESTful and GraphQL APIs from scratch.

**Frontend (ReactJS):**

- Deep dive into **React hooks**, **state management (Redux / Zustand / Recoil)**, **React Query**, and **performance optimization**.
- Learn **TypeScript** (MUST for product companies).
- Practice writing clean, modular, testable components.

**System Design Fundamentals:**

- Learn **how large-scale systems are built** (e.g., authentication, notifications, scaling, load balancing).
- Read resources like:

  - _Grokking the System Design Interview_
  - _System Design Primer (GitHub)_

### 2. Brush Up CS Fundamentals

Even if you’re from a service background, you’ll need strong **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** knowledge for product companies.

Focus on:

- Arrays, Strings, Hashmaps
- Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees, Graphs
- Sorting, Searching, Recursion
- Dynamic Programming basics

Use:

- **LeetCode** (Start from Easy → Medium)
- **NeetCode roadmap**
- **Educative.io Grokking series**

---

## 🚀 Phase 2: Build Your Portfolio (Weeks 4–6)

### 3. Create 2–3 High-Impact Projects

Your GitHub + resume should show **real-world, product-level work**.

Examples:

1. **Full-stack project** → React + Node + MongoDB + JWT auth + Deployment (Vercel + Render)
2. **System design clone** → e.g., a mini Twitter, Uber, or Trello clone.
3. **Performance-optimized app** → SSR with Next.js or caching APIs using Redis.

**Key:** Write clean code, test cases (Jest), proper README, and deploy it publicly.

### 4. Resume & LinkedIn Optimization

- Highlight **impact**, not just tasks.

  > ❌ “Worked on API development.”
  > ✅ “Designed and deployed scalable REST APIs handling 10K+ daily requests.”

- Add **tech stack badges**, **GitHub links**, and **deployed project URLs**.
- Tailor your resume for **product-based culture** (metrics, ownership, problem-solving).

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: Interview Preparation (Weeks 7–10)

### 5. Practice Interviews

**Types of interviews:**

- **Coding (DSA)** → LeetCode daily practice
- **System Design** → Learn trade-offs, scaling strategies
- **Behavioral** → Prepare for “Tell me about a challenge…” using STAR method

**Resources:**

- _Exercism.io_, _AlgoExpert_, _Interviewing.io_
- YouTube: TechWithTim, Harkirat Singh, Gaurav Sen, Tech Dummies

### 6. Mock Interviews

- Do **2–3 mocks/week** with peers or on platforms like **Pramp**, **InterviewBuddy**, or **Gainlo**.
- Record yourself and review your explanations — communication matters.

---

## 💼 Phase 4: Apply & Network (Weeks 10–12)

### 7. Smart Job Hunting

- Use **LinkedIn**, **Wellfound (AngelList)**, **Hirect**, **Cutshort**, **Naukri (Product filter)**.
- Target startups or mid-size product firms (faster feedback and growth).
- Get **referrals** via LinkedIn — don’t just apply blindly.

### 8. Showcase Your Expertise

- Start writing short **tech posts** on LinkedIn or Medium (e.g., “How I built a scalable Node API”).
- Contribute to **open source** or **help in GitHub issues**.
- Build a small **personal website** or portfolio to showcase your skills.

## 📈 Long-Term Growth Tips

- **Learn TypeScript** → Non-negotiable now.
- **Understand cloud (AWS/GCP basics)** → deployment, CI/CD.
- **Read codebases** of open-source projects (e.g., Next.js, Strapi).
- **Keep a journal** of every new topic learned — revise weekly.
- **Stay consistent** — even 2 hours/day beats random bursts.
