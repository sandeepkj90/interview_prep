## **2. First Priority Interview Questions**

5. Explain the phases of the event loop.

### **Explain the difference between `require` and `import` in Node.js**

In Node.js, both `require` and `import` are used to include modules. Here’s a detailed comparison:

#### `require` (CommonJS)

**Syntax:**

```js
const module = require("./module");
```

- Works **synchronously**: Modules are loaded and executed immediately when `require` is called.
- Suitable for traditional Node.js projects.

  ```js
  // module.js
  module.exports = function () {
  	console.log("Hello from CommonJS!");
  };

  // main.js
  const greet = require("./module");
  greet(); // Output: Hello from CommonJS!
  ```

- Supported in all versions of Node.js.
- Can be used **dynamically** inside functions or conditionals.
  ```js
  if (condition) {
  	const module = require("./module");
  }
  ```

#### `import` (ECMAScript Modules - ESM)

**Syntax:**

```js
import module from "./module.js";
```

- Uses **ECMAScript Modules (ESM)**, a standardized module system introduced in ES6 (ES2015).
- Requires setting `"type": "module"` in `package.json` or using `.mjs` file extensions.

- Works **asynchronously**: Modules are pre-parsed and can be optimized before execution.
- Encouraged for modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

  ```js
  // module.js
  export default function () {
  	console.log("Hello from ESM!");
  }

  // main.js
  import greet from "./module.js";
  greet(); // Output: Hello from ESM!
  ```

- Supported in Node.js 12+ with the proper configuration.

- Uses `import()` function for dynamic imports.
  ```js
  if (condition) {
  	const module = await import("./module.js");
  }
  ```

### Summary of Differences

| Aspect                      | `require` (CommonJS) | `import` (ESM)                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Module System               | CommonJS             | ECMAScript Modules (ESM)                |
| File Extensions             | `.js` by default     | `.mjs` or `.js` with `"type": "module"` |
| Synchronous vs Asynchronous | Synchronous          | Asynchronous                            |
| Dynamic Loading             | Supported directly   | Supported via `import()` function       |
| Default Export Syntax       | `module.exports =`   | `export default`                        |
| Support                     | All Node.js versions | Node.js 12+ with config                 |

### **What is NPM? How do you update NPM to the latest version?**

- **NPM (Node Package Manager)** is the default package manager for **Node.js**.
- It is used to manage, share, and install libraries or dependencies for JavaScript projects.
- When you install Node.js, NPM gets installed automatically.

**Key Features of NPM:**

- **Online Repository:** Provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- **Dependency Management:** Automatically handles dependencies defined in `package.json`.

**Common Commands:**

- `npm init`: Create a `package.json` file for your project.
- `npm install <package>`: Install a package.
- `npm uninstall <package>`: Remove a package.
- `npm list`: Show installed packages.

**To update NPM**, you can use one of the following methods:

#### **Using NPM Itself (Recommended)**

Run this command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```

- This installs the **latest stable version** globally.
- You may need to use `sudo` on Linux/macOS:
  ```bash
  sudo npm install -g npm@latest
  ```

#### **Using `nvm` (Node Version Manager)**

If you use `nvm`, you can reinstall Node.js to get the latest NPM:

```bash
nvm install node --reinstall-packages-from=node
```

- This command updates to the latest Node.js version and reinstalls your global packages.

#### **Verify the Update**

Check the NPM version with:

```bash
npm -v
```

---

### **What is `npm audit` and how do you use it?**

- **`npm audit`** is a command in **NPM** that checks your project's dependencies for **security vulnerabilities**.
- It scans the packages listed in `package-lock.json` or `node_modules` and reports any known security issues along with recommendations for fixing them.

**1. Run a Security Audit**

```bash
npm audit
```

- **What it does:**
  - Scans your dependencies for vulnerabilities.
  - Outputs a report with the type and severity (low, moderate, high, critical) of any issues found.

**2. Fix Vulnerabilities Automatically**

```bash
npm audit fix
```

- Tries to **automatically fix** vulnerabilities by updating dependencies to secure versions.
- Modifies `package-lock.json` and sometimes `package.json`.
- Safe for minor and patch-level updates.
- **Limitations:**
  - Does not fix issues that require **major version upgrades**.

**3. Force Fix All Issues (Risky)**

```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

- Forces updates, including **major version changes**.
- Can potentially break your project if new major versions have breaking changes.

**4. View a Detailed Report**

```bash
npm audit --json
```

- Outputs a **detailed JSON report** of vulnerabilities.
- Useful for parsing the results programmatically.

**Example:**

```
┌───────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Critical      │ Arbitrary Code Execution                                     │
├───────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Package       │ lodash                                                      │
├───────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Patched in    │ >=4.17.19                                                   │
├───────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Dependency of │ my-app                                                      │
├───────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Path          │ my-app > some-package > lodash                              │
└───────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **What is the purpose of `npx` in Node.js?**

- **`npx`** (Node Package Execute) is a command-line tool that comes bundled with **NPM (version 5.2.0 and above)**.
- Its main purpose is to **execute Node.js packages directly** without needing to install them globally on your system.

**Key Purposes of `npx`**
Here are some common uses:

- You can execute a package directly without installing it globally.  
  **Example:** Run `create-react-app` without installing it globally.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

- Downloads the package temporarily.
- Executes it.
- Deletes it after execution.

- If a package is installed locally in `node_modules`, you can run it directly using `npx`.  
  **Example:** Running ESLint locally.

```bash
npx eslint .  # No need to use ./node_modules/.bin/eslint
```

- Run a specific version of a package without installing it globally.  
  **Example:** Running a specific version of TypeScript.

```bash
npx typescript@4.5.4 --version
```

- Run code directly from GitHub repositories.  
  **Example:**

```bash
npx github:username/repo-name
```

- With `npx`, you don’t need to install packages globally, reducing version conflicts and system clutter.

**Comparison: `npx` vs `npm`**

| **Aspect**               | **`npx`**                      | **`npm`**                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Execution                | Runs packages **directly**     | Installs and then runs packages           |
| Installation Requirement | No global install needed       | Requires install first (`npm install -g`) |
| Use Case                 | Temporary or one-time commands | Permanent or repeated use                 |
| Default Availability     | Bundled with NPM 5.2.0+        | Installed with Node.js                    |
