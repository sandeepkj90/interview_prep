Got it 👍 — here’s a **detailed syllabus for React.js**, starting from **absolute beginner concepts** to **advanced-level topics**. This roadmap will help you structure your learning path and ensure you cover all essential areas.

# 📘 React.js Syllabus (Beginner → Advanced)

## 1. **Foundations (Prerequisites)**

Before diving into React, you should be comfortable with:

- **HTML & CSS**

  - Semantic HTML, forms, inputs, media, flexbox, grid.

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

  - Variables (`let`, `const`)
  - Functions (arrow, higher-order)
  - Objects, arrays, destructuring
  - Template literals
  - Modules (`import`/`export`)
  - Spread/rest operator
  - Promises & async/await
  - DOM basics (querySelector, event listeners)

- **Basic Git & GitHub**

---

## 2. **React Basics**

- What is React? Why React? SPA concept
- Setting up React project (CRA, Vite, Next.js basics)
- JSX syntax
- Components

  - Functional Components vs Class Components
  - Props (passing data)
  - Default props & PropTypes

- Rendering lists (`map`)
- Conditional rendering (`if`, ternary, logical &&)
- Handling events (onClick, onChange)
- Forms & Controlled components
- **React Developer Tools** in browser

---

## 3. **React State Management (Core Hooks)**

- Understanding State (`useState`)
- State vs Props
- Event handling with state
- Two-way data binding
- `useEffect`

  - Component lifecycle equivalents (mount, update, unmount)
  - Side effects (API calls, timers, subscriptions)

- `useRef` for DOM reference & mutable values
- `useMemo` & `useCallback` (performance optimization)

---

## 4. **Styling in React**

- Inline styles
- CSS modules
- Styled Components
- Tailwind CSS / Chakra UI / Material UI basics

---

## 5. **Routing**

- React Router

  - Installation & setup
  - `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Routes>`, `<Route>`
  - Navigation (`useNavigate`, `<Link>`)
  - Nested routes
  - URL parameters & query strings
  - Protected routes

---

## 6. **Fetching & Managing Data**

- Fetch API / Axios
- API integration with `useEffect`
- Error handling & loading states
- Custom hooks for API calls
- React Query / TanStack Query (caching, mutations)

---

## 7. **Forms & Validation**

- Controlled vs Uncontrolled forms
- Formik / React Hook Form
- Validation with Yup / Zod
- Dynamic forms

---

## 8. **Context API**

- Creating context
- Using `useContext`
- Avoiding prop drilling
- Context with reducers

---

## 9. **State Management (Beyond Context)**

- Redux Toolkit

  - Store, reducers, actions
  - `useSelector` and `useDispatch`
  - Async thunks

- Zustand (lightweight state management)
- Recoil / Jotai basics

---

## 10. **Performance Optimization**

- React memo
- `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Lazy loading & code splitting (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`)
- Virtualization (React Virtualized / React Window)

---

## 11. **Advanced React Patterns**

- Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
- Render Props
- Compound Components
- Custom Hooks
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled components
- Error boundaries

---

## 12. **Testing**

- Unit testing with Jest
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Mocking APIs
- Snapshot testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

---

## 13. **Next.js (React Framework for Production)**

- File-based routing
- Pre-rendering (SSG, SSR, ISR)
- API routes
- Image optimization
- Middleware
- Authentication in Next.js

---

## 14. **TypeScript with React**

- Typing props & state
- Hooks with TypeScript
- Context API with TypeScript
- Generics with React components

---

## 15. **React with Backend & Full-Stack Integration**

- REST API integration
- GraphQL (Apollo Client / Relay)
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth, Firebase Auth)
- File uploads
- WebSockets / Real-time apps

---

## 16. **Production & Deployment**

- Environment variables
- Optimizing bundle size
- Code splitting
- CI/CD for React apps
- Deploying to:

  - Vercel
  - Netlify
  - AWS / Azure / GCP

---

## 17. **Extras (Advanced Topics for Expert Level)**

- Server Components (React 18+)
- Suspense with Data Fetching
- React Concurrent Mode (concepts)
- Micro-frontend architecture
- Monorepos with React (Nx, Turborepo)
- Design systems in React
- Internationalization (i18n)

---

👉 By completing this syllabus step by step, you’ll go from a **beginner React developer** to an **advanced React professional** ready for real-world projects.
