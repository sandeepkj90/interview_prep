Done ✅
I’ve **cleaned up and properly structured the entire plan** in the canvas with:

* Clear headings & sub-headings
* Consistent **Day / Week indentation**
* Readable bullet hierarchy
* Professional formatting (ready for notes, Notion, or printing)

This version is now:

* 📌 **Easy to follow day-by-day**
* 📌 **Interview-ready structured**
* 📌 **Shareable / printable**

### Recommended next move (important)

To make this plan **actionable**, the next best step is ONE of these:

1️⃣ Convert this into a **Google Calendar–style daily checklist**
2️⃣ Give you **8 MERN-based system design answers** (exact interview narration)
3️⃣ Rewrite your **resume for Senior / Staff roles** based on this roadmap
4️⃣ Run a **mock system design interview** (real question + evaluation)

👉 Tell me **which one you want next**, and I’ll continue from there.
