For **7–8 years of experience as a Node.js developer**, you’re expected to go **beyond the basics** and have strong expertise in **architecture, performance, scalability, security, and DevOps practices**. Here’s a **comprehensive list of major topics** you must be well-versed in:

---

## 🔹 Core Node.js Fundamentals

- Event loop, call stack, and microtask queue
- Streams, Buffers, and Pipes
- Asynchronous programming: callbacks, promises, async/await
- Error handling (synchronous vs asynchronous errors)
- Child processes, worker threads, clustering
- File system operations and OS module

---

## 🔹 Backend & API Development

- Building RESTful APIs (Express.js, Fastify, Koa, NestJS)
- GraphQL APIs (Apollo, Mercurius)
- API design best practices (versioning, pagination, filtering, HATEOAS)
- WebSockets, SSE, and real-time communication (Socket.IO, ws)
- gRPC and RPC patterns

---

## 🔹 Database Expertise

- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL) – schema design, query optimization, transactions
- NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Redis) – schema design, indexing, aggregation
- ORMs & ODMs (Sequelize, TypeORM, Prisma, Mongoose)
- Database connection pooling and performance tuning

---

## 🔹 System Design & Architecture

- Monolith vs Microservices vs Serverless architectures
- API Gateway, BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) patterns
- Event-driven architecture (Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS)
- CQRS and Event Sourcing
- Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached, CDN)
- Load balancing and scaling (horizontal vs vertical)

---

## 🔹 Performance & Optimization

- Profiling and debugging (Node Inspector, Chrome DevTools)
- Clustering and load balancing in Node.js
- Memory leaks, garbage collection tuning
- Asynchronous vs synchronous bottlenecks
- High-performance logging (Winston, Pino)

---

## 🔹 Security & Best Practices

- Authentication & Authorization (JWT, OAuth2, Passport, Keycloak)
- Secure coding practices (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection prevention)
- HTTPS/TLS, secure headers, CORS
- Rate limiting, throttling, request validation
- Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, dotenv)

---

## 🔹 Testing & Quality

- Unit testing (Mocha, Jest, Ava)
- Integration & E2E testing (Supertest, Cypress, Playwright)
- Test-driven development (TDD) & Behavior-driven development (BDD)
- Contract testing for microservices (Pact)
- Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, SonarQube)

---

## 🔹 DevOps & CI/CD

- Docker & containerization
- Kubernetes for scaling services
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
- Cloud platforms: AWS (Lambda, ECS, S3, DynamoDB), GCP, Azure
- Monitoring & logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/EFK stack)

---

## 🔹 Advanced JavaScript & TypeScript

- Deep understanding of closures, prototypes, and inheritance
- Functional programming concepts in JS
- Module systems (CommonJS, ESM)
- TypeScript with Node.js (types, generics, decorators)
- Design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Dependency Injection)

---

## 🔹 Messaging & Distributed Systems

- Message queues & brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS, NATS)
- Pub/Sub architectures
- Event-driven microservices
- Saga patterns & distributed transactions

---

## 🔹 Other Must-Know Areas

- API documentation (Swagger, OpenAPI)
- Version control (Git, branching strategies, GitFlow)
- Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)
- Code review & collaboration best practices
- Experience with monorepos (Nx, Turborepo, Lerna)

---

✅ At **7–8 years**, interviewers and employers expect you to be:

- **Architecting scalable solutions** (not just coding APIs)
- **Leading teams & mentoring juniors**
- **Ensuring performance, reliability, and security** in production
- **Bridging between development and DevOps/infra**

---

Do you want me to create a **roadmap with priority levels** (like must-have, good-to-have, advanced) so you can focus your preparation better?
