In Node.js (or any web-based application using HTTP), status codes are derived from the HTTP protocol. Hereâ€™s a detailed list of all HTTP status codes categorized by their type:

---

## **1xx - Informational Responses**

These indicate that the request has been received and is being processed.

- **100 Continue** â€“ The server received the initial request and the client should continue sending the rest.
- **101 Switching Protocols** â€“ The server is switching protocols as requested by the client.
- **102 Processing** â€“ The request is being processed, but no response is available yet (WebDAV).
- **103 Early Hints** â€“ The server sends preliminary headers to improve performance.

---

## **2xx - Success Responses**

These indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

- **200 OK** â€“ The request was successful.
- **201 Created** â€“ A new resource has been created as a result of the request.
- **202 Accepted** â€“ The request has been received but is still being processed.
- **203 Non-Authoritative Information** â€“ The response is modified from a third-party source.
- **204 No Content** â€“ The request was successful, but there is no response body.
- **205 Reset Content** â€“ Instructs the client to reset its document view.
- **206 Partial Content** â€“ Partial content is returned (used for range requests).
- **207 Multi-Status** â€“ Multiple status codes are sent for different operations (WebDAV).
- **208 Already Reported** â€“ A resource has already been reported in this request (WebDAV).
- **226 IM Used** â€“ The server completed the request using instance manipulations.

## **3xx - Redirection Responses**

These indicate that the client must take additional action to complete the request.

- **300 Multiple Choices** â€“ Multiple options are available for the requested resource.
- **301 Moved Permanently** â€“ The requested resource has been permanently moved.

- **303 See Other** â€“ Redirects to a different resource, often used after a POST request.
- **304 Not Modified** â€“ The resource has not been modified, so the cached version is used.

- **307 Temporary Redirect** â€“ The requested resource is temporarily redirected.
- **308 Permanent Redirect** â€“ The resource is permanently moved but should use the same HTTP method.

## **5xx - Server Error Responses**

These indicate that the server encountered an error while processing the request.

- **500 Internal Server Error** â€“ A generic error occurred on the server.
- **501 Not Implemented** â€“ The server does not support the requested functionality.
- **502 Bad Gateway** â€“ The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.

## **How to Use HTTP Status Codes in Node.js**

In Node.js, status codes are typically used in responses when working with frameworks like **Express.js**:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
	res.status(200).send("OK");
});

app.get("/not-found", (req, res) => {
	res.status(404).send("Not Found");
});

app.get("/server-error", (req, res) => {
	res.status(500).send("Internal Server Error");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
	console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```
